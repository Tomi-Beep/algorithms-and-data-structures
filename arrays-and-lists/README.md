# Arrays and Lists
## Problem 1
For a given array with N integers, all the elements that are lower than the average of the whole array need to be deleted. For example for the array 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 the average is (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5) / 5 = 15 / 5 = 3 which means that the elements 1 and 2 should be deleted, so the array after the transformation will be 3, 4, 5.

Input: The first number in the input is the number of integers in the array N, then in the next line the elements are given, separated by spaces.

Output: The array before and after the transformation.

## Problem 2
You are given a single linked list with String nodes. Additionally, you are given one more integer L. You need to delete every node from the list that contains a String with less than L characters.

Input: In the first line from the input the number of elements in the list is given - N, and then in the next N lines the elements themselves. In the last line, the integer L is given.

Output: The list before and after the transformation

## Problem 3
You are given a single linked list with String nodes. Additionally, you are given one more integer L. You need to insert a new node with value "Target" after each node that contains a String with exactly L characters in the list.

Input: In the first line from the input the number of elements in the list is given - N, and then in the next N lines the elements themselves. In the last line, the integer L is given.

Output: The list before and after the transformation

## Problem 4
You are given a single linked list with String nodes. Additionally, you are given one more integer L. You need to insert a new node with value "Outlier" before each node that contains a String with more than L characters in the list.

Input: In the first line from the input the number of elements in the list is given - N, and then in the next N lines the elements themselves. In the last line, the integer L is given.

Output: The list before and after the transformation

## Problem 5
You are given a single linked list with String nodes. Additionally, you are given one more integer L. You need to move all nodes from the list that contain a String with exactly L characters to the end of the list, keeping the original order of elements as well.

Input: In the first line from the input the number of elements in the list is given - N, and then in the next N lines the elements themselves. In the last line, the integer L is given.

Output: The list before and after the transformation

## Problem 6
Дадена е еднострана поврзана листа чии што јазли содржат по еден String. Дополнително, даден е и уште еден природен број L. Од дадената листа потребно е да се најде последниот јазел којшто содржи String со должина L и да се премести на почеток на листата.

Влез: Во првиот ред од влезот е даден бројот на елементи во листата - N, па во следните N редови се дадени самите елементи (String-ови) од листата. На крај, во последниот ред е даден бројот L. 

Излез: На излез треба да се испечати листата пред и после промената.

You are given a single linked list with String nodes. Additionally, you are given one more integer L. You need to find the last node that contains a String with exactly L characters, and move it to the front of the list.

Input: In the first line from the input the number of elements in the list is given - N, and then in the next N lines the elements themselves. In the last line, the integer L is given.

Output: The list before and after the transformation

## Problem 7
You are given a doubly-linked list of integers. Additionally, there is one more natural number k. You need to rotate the elements of the list k times to the right.

Input: The first number in the input is the number of integers in the list - N, then in the next line the elements are given, separated by spaces. Then, in the last line, the natural number k is given.

Output: The list before and after the transformation

## Problem 8
You are given a doubly-linked list of integers. Additionally, there is one more natural number k. You need to rotate the elements of the list k times to the left.

Input: The first number in the input is the number of integers in the list - N, then in the next line the elements are given, separated by spaces. Then, in the last line, the natural number k is given.

Output: The list before and after the transformation

## Problem 9
You are given a doubly-linked list of integers. Additionally, there is one more integer M and a natural number k. You need to find the first occurence of M in the list and move that node k times to the left.

Input: The first number in the input is the number of integers in the list - N, then in the next line the elements are given, separated by spaces. Then, in the last two lines, the integer M and the natural number k are given.

Output: The list before and after the transformation

## Problem 10
You are given a doubly-linked list of integers. Additionally, there is one more natural number k. You need to replace the last k elements of the list to the beginning of the list, in the same order.

Input: The first number in the input is the number of integers in the list - N, then in the next line the elements are given, separated by spaces. Then, in the last line, the natural number k is given. (k<=N)

Output: The list before and after the transformation

## Problem 11
For a given doubly-linked list with N integers, you need to find the number of elements such that the average of all elements before it is bigger than the average of all elements after it in the list. 

Input: The first number in the input is the number of integers in the list N, then in the next line the elements are given, separated by spaces.

Output: The number of elements that satisfy the condition.
