# Algorithms and Data Structures - Faculty of Computer Science and Engineering
Includes all the codes I've written for problems during my 3rd semester of Computer Science at FINKI for the subject "Algorithms and Data Structures".

All laboratory problems were solved in person, without any additional tools or help.
